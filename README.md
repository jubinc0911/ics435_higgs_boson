I used LightGBM, XGBoost, and AutoGluon for predicting the binary classifcation task.
Within that, I employed Optuna for hyperparameter optimization. 

Higgs_Boson_Report: The task report for this assignment

There are two versions of Jupyter Notebooks:  
Higgs_Boson.ipynb: 
- Output remained on the file

Higgs_Boson_Clear_Output.ipnyb:
- Output is cleared because the outputs are expanded in GitHub (it's extremely long that unable to properly read it). Thus, cleared outputs version notebook.


To run the code, check install_requirements.txt for configuration.
